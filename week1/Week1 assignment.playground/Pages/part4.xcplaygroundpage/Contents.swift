/*:
1. Here is an array:\
`let lottoNumbers = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5]`\
 Please use For-In loop and Range to print the last three members in the
 .lottoNumbers. array.
 for  in lottoNumbers{
 
 }

 
 \
 2. Please use a for-in loop to print the results as the images listed below respectively
 (through .lottoNumbers.):\
 
 `for number in  lottoNumbers{
    if number / 2 == 0 {
        print(number)
    }
 }`
 \
 3. Please use a while loop to solve the Q2.
 
 \
 4. Please use a repeat-while loop to solve Q2.
 
 \
 5. What are the differences between while and repeat-while?
 
 \
 6. Declare a variable isRaining to record the weather. Please write a statement that if the weather is raining, print “It’s raining, I don’t want to work today.”, otherwise print “Although it’s sunny, I still don’t want to work today.”
 
 \
 7. In a company, we might use numbers to represent job levels. Let’s make an example. We use 1 for the Member, 2 for Team Leader, 3 for Manager, and 4 for Director.
 Now, declare a variable named jobLevel and assign a number to it. If the jobLevel number is in our list, print the relative job title name; if not, just print “We don't have this job”. Please use the if-else statement and the switch statement to complete this requirement separately.
